A few notes about the sections above:
 
*   "Contributors" is a comma separated list of wp.orgusernames
*   "Stable tag" is not needed for themes
*   "Tags" is not needed since these are parsed from the style.css file
*   "Requires at least" is the lowest version that the plugin will work on
*   "Tested up to" is the highest version that you've *successfully used to test the theme*. Note that it might work on
higher versions... this is just the highest one you've verified.
